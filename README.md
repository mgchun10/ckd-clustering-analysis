# CKD Clustering Analysis

This project applies unsupervised learning techniques to a Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) dataset to discover and describe inherent clusters in patient data. The goal is to explore meaningful groupings that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying risk profiles and tailoring treatment strategies.

## Project Overview

- **Topic**: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Clustering
- **Techniques Used**: t-SNE, K-Means, DBSCAN, Silhouette Analysis, Cluster Similarity Matrices, PCA
- **Goal**: Identify, evaluate, and describe the inherent clustering structure within a real-world medical dataset using unsupervised learning.

## Motivation

CKD is a progressive condition with significant variability in patient risk profiles. Identifying clusters among CKD patients can help reveal distinct groups who may benefit from targeted clinical attention, early intervention, or personalized treatment plans. This clustering analysis aims to support data-driven decision-making in healthcare.

## Dataset

- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository â€“ CKD Dataset  
  https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Chronic_Kidney_Disease
- **Note**: The dataset contains both categorical and numerical variables and includes missing values that were handled during preprocessing.

## ðŸ”„ Future Work

- Explore fuzzy clustering for overlapping risk profiles
- Incorporate semi-supervised methods using diagnostic labels
- Develop clinical dashboards for interactive cluster exploration
